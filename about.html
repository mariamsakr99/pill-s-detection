      <p>
        Pill detection involves identifying pills by their physical
        characteristics, such as shape, color, and markings. This can be done
        manually by comparing the pill to a database or using automated systems
        like pill recognition apps. These apps often utilize image recognition
        technology to identify pills based on pictures taken by users.

        When it comes to pill interaction, it refers to the way different
        medications can affect each other when taken together. Certain
        combinations of pills can lead to adverse effects or reduce the
        effectiveness of one or more medications. It's crucial to consult
        healthcare professionals or use tools like drug interaction checkers to
        ensure the safety and efficacy of medication regimens.
